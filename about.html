					<h3>Anna University college code - 3110</h3>
					<p>KCG continues to attract leading organizations across different 
                        industries at its campus interviews every year. An active Placement 
                        Cell ensures that students receive the necessary support, training 
                        and direction they need to choose the right jobs and perform well in 
                        interviews.
                        
                       <br><br> Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India has established ‘MHRD’s Innovation Cell (MIC)’ to systematically foster the culture of Innovation amongst all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The primary mandate of MIC is to encourage, inspire and nurture young students by supporting them to work with new ideas and transform them into prototypes while they are informative years. In the process, KCG has started Institutions Innovation Council (IIC) in November 2018 and formed a council comprising of internal faculty members and external experts to monitor the progress and activities of IIC on campus.
